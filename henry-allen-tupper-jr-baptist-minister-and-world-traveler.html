And the bloody work was stopped, not because the Moslems did not want to make a clean sweep of the Christians and pillage all their goods, but because those who inspired the slaughter thought that one, two or three days of killing was about as much as Europe would stand at one time. Turkish Toleration. Nor let it be supposed that the Turks as such, hate the Armenians as such. The Armenians have been for centuries the most submissive and profitable subjects; and they would still be most loyal, if, instead of the increasingly oppressive policy of the Sultan Abdul Hamid, their lives and honor and property had been even tolerably protected. All this, many Turks know very well, and regret the cruel and utterly impolitic course of the present sovereign. <em><strong>The Turk, as a man, has many excellent qualities. It is his religion which at certain times makes a devil of him.</strong></em> It is the very essence of Mohammedanism that the Giaour has no right to live save in subjection.</p></blockquote><p>Henry, a Baptist, praised the Armenians for their loyalty to Christianity:</p><blockquote><p>For more than a thousand years, the Armenians have been subjected to the bitterest persecutions, and during these centuries they have willingly chosen death with terrible torture, rather than prove false to their faith.</p></blockquote><p>Henry despaired because the apathy of the European Powers would offer no help to the Armenians. He proposed allowing the entire Armenian nation to emigrate to Canada and the United States. But nothing was done. The Turks noted that the Armenians had no friends, and began to murder them systematically, killing between 1 and 1 1/2 million, driving them into the deserts to die of thirst and starvation.</p><p><a href="/site/assets/files/1074/armenains-1.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3018]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3066" src="/site/assets/files/1074/armenains-1.jpg" alt="Armenains 1" width="277" height="182"></a> <a href="/site/assets/files/1074/armenians.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3018]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3067" src="/site/assets/files/1074/armenians.jpg" alt="Armenians" width="275" height="184"></a></p><p>Still no one cared.

She had lived in Mexico City for eleven month as a correspondent.&nbsp;One day she and her father walked downtown to a movie. She said that</p><blockquote><p>[we] had been watching the pictures about 15 minutes when hundreds of persons rushed in seeking refuge. When the place was filled the great iron shutters, which completely lock up the doors and windows of all the stores of Mexico City, were thrown into place. There we were herded like cattle, with the sound of bullets singing outside for several hours, when everything was declared safe, teh doors thrown open and we went out into teh street. The picked our way over the bodies of several citizens and horses and made our way home. The town hadn’t been attacked at all. It seemed that one group of soldiers merely wanted the horses that another group was riding.</p></blockquote><p>Carranza buttered Henry up and expressed &nbsp;great interest&nbsp;in education in Mexico and a desire to establish complete religious liberty n Mexico. Carranza insisted on paying Henry’s travel expenses; Henry asked the opinion of Carranza’s attorney, who said Henry could accept the offer of $3,466 as reimbursement.</p><p>Carranza asked for an end to the embargo on American arms. &nbsp;Meanwhile Pancho Villa was raiding across the border and whole Mexican armies and their families were seeking refuge in Texas.</p><p>Henry’s father had been corresponding secretary of missions for the Southern Baptists,and had helped found Baptist schools in Saltillo, Mexico. Henry’s sister Mary Caldwell taught there, which the plight of the school a special pathos.</p><blockquote><p>horses were stalled in the very room&nbsp; where my sister taught these girls,&nbsp; and I felt rather a personal interest in it, as my father had dedicated it.</p></blockquote><p>Henry’s attempts to help got him into trouble; he had to explain his actions to the hostile Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p><p>Cardinal Gibbons had written Henry to thank him for his work in Mexico, but the Jesuits in <em>America</em> claimed that the Constitutionalists were tools of the Protestants and had paid a bribe to Henry – who fortunately had kept records of all correspondence and deposits.</p><p>Henry lamented,</p><blockquote><p>there are some people in the world who never get their eyes above dirt. It is money, money, money all the time.</p></blockquote><p>As &nbsp;Senator Albert Fall pointed out to Henry, &nbsp;the 1917 Mexican constitution had forbidden any foreign-born clergy from working in Mexico and had forbidden any religious organization to operate any type of educational institution. Henry had been deceived; he should have listened to what he himself had said:</p><blockquote><p>the more and more I studied Mexico…the more mysterious Mexico became. After I first paid my visit there I lectured on Mexico. The second time a paid a visit there I stopped lecturing on Mexico because I saw many angles to the situation.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'arial black', 'avant garde'; font-size: 14pt;">Washington, D.C.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/site/assets/files/1074/first-baptist-dc-209x300.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3018]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3034" src="/site/assets/files/1074/first-baptist-dc-209x300.png" alt="First Baptist DC" width="209" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px"></a><strong><em>The old First Baptist, 16th St., Washington, D.C.</em></strong><a href="http://www.podles.org/dialogue/wp-content/uploads/First-Baptist-Montclair-1.jpg" target="_blank"><br>

He was born March 13, 1889, in Milwaukee, the son of Julius Gugler and Bertha Rose Bremer. According to Camoupedia</p><blockquote><p>“Gugler is a prominent name in the printing industry in Milwaukee WI. It begins with a German-born engraver named Henry Gugler, Sr. (1816-1880), who came to the US in 1853. During the Civil War, he was an important engraver for the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington DC, producing, among other famous works, a life-sized steel engraving of Abraham Lincoln. In the 1870s, he moved to Milwaukee and became a partner with his son Julius Gugler (1848-1919) in the H. Gugler &amp; Son Lithographing Company.</p>
<p>According to certain sources, Julius Gugler was a poet as well as a printer. Among other art-inclined family members were his daughter Frida Gugler (1874-1966), a painter who had studied with William Merrit Chase, and her younger brother, Eric Gugler (1889-1974), who achieved considerable success as a muralist, sculptor, interior designer and architect.</p>
<p>As an aspiring artist-architect, Gugler studied at The Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, then also earned a BA degree at Columbia University in 1911. For three years, before the war began, he also studied at the American Academy in Rome.</p></blockquote><p>While in Rome Gugler, according to David H. Wright,</p><blockquote><p>developed a scheme for a monumental approach to S. Pietro,&nbsp; calling for the old Borgo to be replaced&nbsp; by a vast tree-lined boulevard articulated by a series of reflecting pools leading from Bernini’s piazza to a much larger obelisk and vast circular piazza by the Tiber/ At least Gugler’s project was less brutal that Mussolini’s Via della Conziliatione.</p></blockquote><p>Eric was in the military from October 10, 1917 to December 6, 1918. There he had an unusual job (which is why he is in Camoupedia): designing camouflage for ships to protect them from submarine attack.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-ship-design.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5039" src="/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-ship-design.jpg" alt="Eric Gugler ship design" width="385" height="462" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px"></a></p><p><em>Eric Gugler, three-stage diagram (c1918) in which actual structural changes are made to the height and positioning of a ship’s masts, smoke stacks, and other features in order to throw off the course calculations of U-boat gunners.</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: cassenet;">Chicago War Memorial</span></p><p>Eric became a fashionable New York architect. His office address was always 101 Park Avue, the office of McKim, Meade, and White. In 1929 he won first prize for a competition for Chicago’s War Memorial.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-war-memorial-1024x843.png" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5040" src="/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-war-memorial-1024x843.png" alt="Eric Gugler War Memorial" width="1024" height="843" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p>David H. Wright comments on the design:</p><p>It was to be an island at the culmination of the axis of Congress Street and Gugler’s scheme called for a rectangular frame of a dozen square piers 200 feet high around a mock sarcophagus big enough for the bones of at least a regiment of casualties. Mussolini would have been delighted but probably would have felt it had too little classical ornament. Mercifully, it was never built.</p><p>He rented a house that Mary Lawrence Tonetti owned; it was on 40<sup>th</sup> St, directly across from the Tonetti’s house – studio. He met Anne, and they married in 1932, with the marriage witnessed by Justice Benjamin Cardozo.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: cassenet; font-size: 18pt;">Forum Auditorium Interior, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</span></strong></p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/forum-auditorium-construction.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5045" src="/site/assets/files/1038/forum-auditorium-construction.jpg" alt="Forum Auditorium construction" width="266" height="189"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Forum Auditorium under construction</em></p><p>In the early Depression years, Eric and his associate Richard Brooks got the commission to design the interior of the Forum Auditorium in the State Education Building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. They</p><blockquote><p>wanted to depict the march of progress of mankind and the overwhelming majesty of the heavens. The maps and adjacent tablets on the upper promenade walls commemorate the socially-significant individuals who made famous the great period of each particular locale. The ceiling was painted on individual canvas sections and decorated with constellations and depictions from the Zodiac. More than one thousand stars are shown in their proper position. Three hundred sixty five are of crystal glass, now illuminated by energy-efficient LED lights.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-forum-interior-1024x684.png" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5041" src="/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-forum-interior-1024x684.png" alt="Eric Gugler Forum Interior" width="1024" height="684" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Forum Auditorium restored</em></p><p>The designers explained their plan:</p><blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">In painting the ceiling of the Forum we have made an effort, however ineffectual it might be, to achieve some idea of the grandeur of the heavens…Outlined in gold against the deep blue background of the sky, they [the constellations] stir the imagination to a vivid realization of the infinite patience and awe with which both common men and philosophers have long studies the heavens. The artists, by their gold and silver and blue pattern, studded with crystal stars, have concentrated this drama of creation into a spectacle of awe and wonder. The long lines of the celestial meridians are spun out in silver like a web of a cosmic spider. The wakes of the planets as they swing through the oceans of endless blue space are traced in foamy white.</p>

Hutchins. It measures nearly four feet high by twenty-seven feet long, and its architect was Eric Gugler. The carved white marble stonework is attributed to Corrado Novani and the Piccirilli Brothers studio, the same firm responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Maine Monument</em>&nbsp;at Columbus Circle and the&nbsp;<em>Lincoln Memorial</em>&nbsp;in Washington, D.C. The sundial component was designed by Albert Stewart, and famed sculptor Paul Manship is credited with the small bronze figure at its center.</p>
<p>Three semicircular lines inscribed in the paving match the bench’s shadow lines at 10:00 a.m., noon, and 2:00 p.m. at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. Etched into the back of the bench are the Latin phrases,&nbsp;<em>Alteri Vivas Oportet Sit Vis Tibi Vivere</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ne Diruat Fuga Temporium</em>. Loosely translated, these mean, “You should live for another if you would live for yourself,” and “Let it not be destroyed by the passage of time.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: cassenet; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Roosevelt Commissions </strong></span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.podles.org/dialogue/wp-content/uploads/Val-Kill-1.jpg" target="_blank"><br>

Arthurdale was set up for unemployed coal miners; it did not work out. It was too isolated for small industry and the farmers could not grow enough to feed themselves.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/arthurdale-designs-gugler-on-right-300x232.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5051" src="/site/assets/files/1038/arthurdale-designs-gugler-on-right-300x232.jpg" alt="Arthurdale designs, Gugler on right" width="300" height="232" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Plans for Arthurdale; Eric on right</em></p><p>Franklin Parker explains some of the difficulties:</p><blockquote><p>Arthurdale faced frequent disagreements, mismanagement, and lack of communication between New Deal and local officials. Louis Howe is said to have told Harold Ickes: you buy the land; I’ll buy the houses. Despite Mrs. Roosevelt’s caution, but pressed by a desire to house the homesteaders before Christmas 1933, Howe ordered by phone 50 prefabricated Cape Code cottages from Boston.</p>
<p>Designed for summer use and unsuitable for northern West Virginia winters, they were also smaller than the foundations prepared for them. Mrs. Roosevelt asked New York architect Eric Gugler to recut, rebuild, and winterize the cottages to fit the foundations and the weather. Costs, of course, skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Arthurdale suffered from too many uncoordinated committees trying to get too many things done too quickly. There was also interference, though well intentioned, from Howe and Mrs. Roosevelt. There were contradictory orders, delays, waste, and cost overruns. Interior Secretary Ickes, a frugal administrator, wrote in his diary, “We have been spending money down there like drunken sailors.”</p></blockquote><p>Despite delays and some incomplete and unoccupied homes, Arthurdale opened officially June 7, 1934.</p><p>C. J. Malone in his book <em>Back to the Land: Arthurdale, FDR’s New Deal, and the Costs of Economic Planning</em>, takes a dim view of the project:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, by July 1934, 43 of the first 50 homes were occupied, and Eric Gugler and his team packed up and headed back home. Having wrecked and wasted his way into Arthurdale’s history, Gugler was called away to Washington, onward and upward to his justly earned rewards, proving yet again that it is not war that is the health of the state; it is failure.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: cassenet; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The West Wing of the White House</strong></span></p><p>Eric Gugler&nbsp;was employed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to rebuild the West Wing of the White House. Perhaps his camouflage background recommend him: Roosevelt wanted an office that would have easier access to the living quarters and conceal as much as possible his polio. The west door opens onto a ptrvate study, minimizing time in the public corridor. There were some precedents.</p><blockquote><p>President&nbsp;William Howard Taft made the West Wing a permanent building, expanding it southward, doubling its size, and building the first Oval Office.&nbsp;Designed by Nathan C. Wyeth and completed in 1909, the office was centered on the south side of the building, much as the oval rooms in the White House are. Taft intended it to be the hub of his administration, and, by locating it in the center of the West Wing, he could be more involved with the day-to-day operation of his presidency. The Taft Oval Office had simple Georgian Revival trim, and was likely the most colorful in history; the walls were covered with vibrant seagrass green burlap.</p></blockquote><p><em><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/tafy-oval-office-300x192.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5052 aligncenter" src="/site/assets/files/1038/tafy-oval-office-300x192.jpg" alt="Tafy Oval Office" width="300" height="192" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Taft’s Oval Office</em></p><p>On December 24, 1929, during President&nbsp; Herbert Hoover’s administration, a fire severely damaged the West Wing. Hoover used this as an opportunity to create more space, excavating a partial basement for additional offices. He restored the Oval Office, upgrading the quality of trim and installing air-conditioning. He also replaced the furniture, which had undergone no major changes in twenty years.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/west-wing-plan.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5054" src="/site/assets/files/1038/west-wing-plan.jpg" alt="West Wing plan" width="292" height="173"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>West Wing floorplan</em></p><p>Dissatisfied with the size and layout of the West Wing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged New York architect Eric Gugler to redesign it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of the building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive “penthouse” story. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler’s most visible addition was the expansion of the building eastward for a new Cabinet Room and Oval Office.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/west-wing-construction.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5053" src="/site/assets/files/1038/west-wing-construction.jpg" alt="West Wing construction" width="261" height="193"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>West Wing under construction</em></p><p>Gugler took the concept of Taft’s office and expanded it in an elegant Classical / Art Moderne mode.

He also came up with the idea of twin chairs flanking the fireplace, so Roosevelt could be photographed sitting and on the same level as visiting dignitaries. That arrangement has been kept.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/oval-office-plan.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5083" src="/site/assets/files/1038/oval-office-plan.jpg" alt="Oval Office plan" width="160" height="213"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Oval Office Plan</em></p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/fdr-at-desk-300x240.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-5090 aligncenter" src="/site/assets/files/1038/fdr-at-desk-300x240.jpg" alt="U.S. head of state at work desk office Oval Office" width="300" height="240" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>FDR in Oval Office</em></p><blockquote><p>The modern Oval Office was built at the West Wing’s southeast corner, offering FDR, who was physically disabled and used a wheelchair, more privacy and easier access to the Residence. He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms, with more robust Georgian details: doors topped with substantial pediments, bookcases set into niches, a deep bracketed cornice, and a ceiling medallion of the Presidential Seal. Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that “wash” the ceiling in light. In small ways, hints of Art Moderne can be seen, in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. FDR and Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler sketching the president’s ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room’s furniture, is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left, and a visiting head of state on the right. This allowed FDR to be seated, with his guests at the same level, de-emphasizing his inability to stand. Construction of the modern Oval Office was completed in 1934.</p>

Then in May 1941, Moses proposed demolishing the structure… Eric Gugler, a former White House architect affiliated with several civic groups dedicated to preserving the history of New York City including the ASHPS and the Fine Arts Federation, immediately contacted the National Park Service and confirmed with Acting Director A. E. Demaray that the preservation of Castle Clinton was under review. By 1942, Moses presented a Battery Park redesign with an open vista onto the Statue of Liberty in place of Castle Clinton. …Even Ole Singstad, the Chief Engineer for the Tunnel Authority, stated that Castle Clinton wouldn’t interfere with the construction of the tunnel. Despite all this effort, in July 1942, the Board of Estimate approved Commissioner Moses’ plan for the park. … However, the need for personnel and equipment for the war effort on the national level made it impossible for Moses’ plan to move forward. During this time, Eric Gugler attempted to gain support from influential people who had their roots in New York City including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Justice Frankfurter provided access to Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior. After the war ended, both sides renewed their efforts to win the fight over Castle Clinton. McAneny and Gugler’s group argued in a letter sent to the New York newspapers that the destruction of Europe during the recent war and the tragic loss of many historic structures should encourage preservation of the 1812 fort. … In August 1946, President Harry Truman signed the bill into law, creating Castle Clinton National Monument.</p></blockquote><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/castle-clinton-300x129.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5065" src="/site/assets/files/1038/castle-clinton-300x129.jpg" alt="Castle Clinton" width="300" height="129" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Castle Clinton today</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: cassenet; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Mayo Memorial 1943-1952</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;<a href="/site/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-mayo.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[5035]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5066" src="/site/assets/files/1038/eric-gugler-mayo.jpg" alt="Eric Gugler Mayo" width="236" height="157"></a></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Charles and William Mayo Memorial, Rochester</em></p><p>Eric designed the setting for the Mayo Memorial.

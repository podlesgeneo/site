					<div id="content">
						<p>William Jay Schieffelin (1866-1955) was the great great grandson of Jacob Schieffelin and of Hannah Lawrence, the poetess. William was therefore my wife’s fourth cousin, twice removed. As his middle name indicates, he was also the great great grandson of John Jay. William married Maria Louisa Vanderbilt Shephard (1870-1948), the daughter of Elliott Fitch Shephard and Margaret Louis Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt fortune and the Schieffelin fortune combined nicely to support of life of both luxury and philanthropy.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-young.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3851" src="/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-young.png" alt="William Jay schieffelin young" width="97" height="92"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: cassenet;">William Jay Schieffelin</span></p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/maria-louisa-shepard-284x300.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3806" src="/site/assets/files/1054/maria-louisa-shepard-284x300.jpg" alt="Maria Louisa Shepard" width="284" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: cassenet;">Maria Louisa Shepard</span></p><p>The marriage of William Jay and Maria Louisa on February 5, 1891 was a marvel of the Gilded Age.</p><blockquote><p>It was one of the premier social events of the year.&nbsp; Before the ceremony, 600 guests attended a wedding breakfast in the two picture galleries of William Vanderbilt’s double mansion.&nbsp; Among the astonishing array of wedding gifts were a silver dinner service for twenty-four, given by Mrs. William Vanderbilt; two silver dishes sent by President Benjamin Harrison and the First Lady; and “a completely-furnished house, the gift of the bride’s mother,” as reported in&nbsp;<em>The Times</em>.</p></blockquote><p>The house was on 57<sup>th</sup> street, just west of Fifth Avenue.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/schieffelin-house-west-57th-111x300.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3744" src="/site/assets/files/1054/schieffelin-house-west-57th-111x300.png" alt="Schieffelin house west 57th" width="111" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/schieffelin-57-street.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3840" src="/site/assets/files/1054/schieffelin-57-street.jpg" alt="Schieffelin 57 street" width="175" height="288"></a></p><p>But commerce encroached, and Mrs. Shepard purchased a double lot at 5 and 7 East 66<sup>th</sup> St, next door to the former home of Ulysses S.

William Jay testified before a Congressional Committee and gave full-page interviews about the problem of addictive substances. He was asked why it was such a large problem in America. He responded:</span></p><blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333; background: white;">The drug business is a very large industry. I suppose that half of it, in money received, comes from patent medicines. Americans believe in and practice self-medication. Some patent medicines, when in liquid form, contain alcohol. Others contain narcotics. Previous to the enactment of the pure food and drugs act of June 30, 1906, the manufacturers of parent medicines were not required to print on their labels the ingredients of their preparations.</span></p>
</blockquote><p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333; background: white;">But the 1906 law changed that and took the onus off of druggists to warn customers.</span></p><blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333; background: white;">The law compels the manufacturer to print the habit-forming ingredients on every bottle of his medicine. If a customer can read he knows what he is taking. The publicity required by law has driven certain catarrh cures in which there is cocaine out of the market. Self-medication in the past, through ignorance, mostly, caused the use of so many habit-forming drugs as to become a serious danger to the country.</span></p>
</blockquote><p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333; background: white;">Although William Jay did not believe cannabis was as dangerous as cocaine he thought it might as well be classified with cocaine, where it remains to this day, with endless complications for law enforcement and conflict of laws.</span></p><p style="line-height: 18pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: cassenet;">The Churchman</span></p><p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/st-george-nyc-2.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3779" src="/site/assets/files/1054/st-george-nyc-2.jpg" alt="St George NYC 2" width="225" height="224" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"></a></p><p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/william-schieefelin-ad-1-280x300.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3781" src="/site/assets/files/1054/william-schieefelin-ad-1-280x300.png" alt="william schieefelin ad 1" width="280" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"></a></p><p>William Jay was an active Episcopalian, vestryman at St. George’s Church. He was a proponent of the Social Gospel, the movement that proclaimed that Christians were supposed to be the light of the nations and help establish the Kingdom by ridding the earth of evils. The Social Gospel was especially directed to men, who did not see much point in pious exercises, but could be told that an active role in combatting evil was an expression of&nbsp; masculinity. That is why William was active in the Men and Religion Forward Movement. The Episcopal Church more than any other church was affected by this Movement and had the greatest increase in the percentage of men in its congregations.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-ad-300x154.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3780" src="/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-ad-300x154.png" alt="William Jay Schieffelin ad" width="300" height="154" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p style="line-height: 18pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: cassenet;">The Soldier</span></p><p style="line-height: 18.0pt;"><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-sr-captain.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3782" src="/site/assets/files/1054/william-jay-schieffelin-sr-captain.png" alt="William Jay Schieffelin Sr Captain" width="171" height="271"></a></p><p>D<span style="color: #000000;">uring the Spanish American War William was a captain and adjutant in the Twelfth Regiment of the National Guard.</span></p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1054/369-poster-243x300.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3742]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3783" src="/site/assets/files/1054/369-poster-243x300.jpg" alt="369 poster" width="243" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"></a></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">In the First World War he was a colonel of the 369<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;Infantry, the Fifteenth Regiment, a “colored” unit. Afro-American units had white officers. Black men wanted to fight, because they wanted to prove they were men, as masculine as the whites who regarded themselves as superior.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">The Regiment consisted of African-Americans and&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_people" target="_blank">African Puerto Ricans</a>&nbsp;and was known for being the first&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" target="_blank">African-American</a>&nbsp;regiment to serve with the&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Force" target="_blank">American Expeditionary Force</a>&nbsp;during World War I. Before the 15th New York National Guard Regiment was formed, any African American that wanted to fight in the war either had to enlist in the French or Canadian armies. The regiment was nicknamed the&nbsp;<strong>Harlem Hellfighters</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Black Rattlers</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Men of Bronze</strong>, which was given to the regiment by the French. The nickname “Hell Fighters” was given to them by the Germans due to their toughness and that they never lost a man through capture, lost a trench or a foot of ground to the enemy. The “Harlem Hellfighters” were the first all black regiment that helped change the American public’s opinion on African American soldiers and helped pave the way for future African American soldiers.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">White American soldiers refused to fight with this unit, so it was assigned to the French, who were delighted to have it.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Two&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medals_of_Honor" target="_blank">Medals of Honor</a>&nbsp;and many&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_States)" target="_blank">Distinguished Service Crosses</a>&nbsp;were awarded to members of the regiment.

Reports suggest that Johnson killed at least four German soldiers and might have wounded 30 others.&nbsp;Usually black achievements and valor went unnoticed, despite that fact over 100 men from the 369th were presented with American and/or French medals.

Washington in raising funds for the colleges. In&nbsp; 1906 William Jay presided over a fund-raising meeting at Carnegie Hall. The prime attraction was Mark Twain, who knew his audience and entertained them with a barbed wit directed at the type of wealthy New Yorker who was likely to be in the audience:</p><blockquote><p>“There being nothing to explain, nothing to refute, nothing to excuse, there is nothing left for me to do, now, but resume my natural trade – which is, teaching. At Tuskegee they thoroughly ground the student in the Christian code of morals; they instill into him the indisputable truth that this is the highest and best of all systems of morals; that the nation’s greatness, its strength, and its repute among the other nations, is the product of that system; that it is the foundation upon which rests the American character; that whatever is commendable, whatever is valuable in the individual American’s character is the flower and fruit of that seed.</p>
<p>“They teach him that this is true in every case, whether the man be a professing Christian or an unbeliever; for we have none but the Christian code of morals, and every individual is under its character-building powerful influence and dominion from the cradle to the grave; he breathes it in with his breath, it is in his blood and bone, it is the web and woof and fibre of his mental and spiritual heredities and ineradicable. And so, every born American among the eighty millions, let his creed or destitution of creed be what it may, is indisputably a Christian to this degree – that his moral constitution is Christian.</p>

<p><strong>Two Codes of Morals</strong></p>
<p>“All this is true, and no student will leave Tuskegee ignorant of it. Then what will he lack, under this head? What is there for me to teach him, under this head, that he may possibly not acquire there, or may acquire in a not sufficiently emphasized form? Why, this large fact, this important fact – that there are two separate and distinct kinds of Christian morals; so separate, so distinct, so unrelated, that they are no more kin to each other than are archangels and politicians. The one kind is Christian private morals, the other is Christian public morals.</p>
<p>“The loyal observance of Christian private morals has made this nation what it is – a clean and upright people in its private domestic life, an honest and honorable people in its private commercial life; no alien nation can claim superiority over it in these regards, no critic, foreign or domestic, can challenge the validity of this truth. During 363 days in the year the American citizen is true to his Christian private morals, and keeps undefiled the nation’s character at its best and highest; then in the other two days of the year he leaves his Christian private morals at home, and carries his Christian public morals to the tax office and the polls, and does the best he can to damage and undo his whole year’s faithful and righteous worth.<strong>y.</strong></p>
<p>“Without a blush he will vote for an unclean boss if that boss is his party’s Moses, without compunction he will vote against the best man in the whole land if he is on the other ticket. Every year, in a number of cities and states, he helps to put corrupt men in office, every year he helps to extend the corruption wider and wider; year after year he goes on gradually rotting the country’s political life; whereas if he would but throw away his Christian public morals, and carry his Christian private morals to the polls, he could promptly purify the public service and make the possession of office a high and honorable distinction and one to be coveted by the very best men the country could furnish. But now – well, now he contemplates his unpatriotic work and sighs, and grieves, and blames every man but the right one – which is himself.</p>
<p>“Once a year he lays aside his Christian private morals and hires a ferry boat and piles up his bonds in a warehouse in New Jersey for three days, and gets out his Christian public morals and goes to the tax office and holds up his hand and swears he wishes he may never-never if he’s got a cent in the world, so help him! The next day the list appears in the papers – a column and a quarter of names, in fine print, and every man in the list a billionaire and a member of a couple of churches.</p>
<p>“I know all those people. I have friendly, social, and criminal intercourse with the whole of them. They never miss a sermon when they are so as to be around, and they never miss swearing-off day, whether they are so as to be around or not. The innocent man can not remain innocent in the disintegrating atmosphere of this thing. I used to be an honest man. I am crumbling. No – I have crumbled. When they assessed me at $75,000 a fortnight ago, I went out and tried to borrow the money, and couldn’t; then when I found they were letting a whole crop of millionaires live in New York at a third of the price they were charging me, I was hurt, I was indignant, and said: ‘This is the last feather! I am not going to run this town all by myself.’ In that moment – in that memorable moment – I began to crumble.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Twain Disintegrates</strong></p>
<p>“In fifteen minutes the disintegration was complete. In fifteen minutes I was become just a mere moral sand pile; and I lifted up my hand along with those seasoned and experienced deacons, and swore off every rag of personal property I’ve got in the world, clear down to cork leg, glass eye, and what is left of my wig.</p>
<p>“Those tax officers were moved; they were profoundly moved. They had long been accustomed to seeing hardened old grafters act like that, and they could endure the spectacle; but they were expecting better things of me, a chartered professional moralist, and they were saddened. I fell visibly in their respect and esteem, and I should have fallen in my own, except that I had already struck bottom, and there wasn’t any place to fall to.</p></blockquote><p>William Jay commented on “progress” in racial relationships (and this in 1925!)</p><blockquote><p>As an example of the improved racial situation Dr. Schieffelin pointed out that the lynching of negroes in the country decreased 50 percent during the past year.</p></blockquote><p>In 1932 William Jay became the chairman of the defense committee for the Scottsboro Boys.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">The&nbsp;<strong>Scottsboro Boys</strong>&nbsp;were nine&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" target="_blank">African-American</a>&nbsp;teenagers accused in&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" target="_blank">Alabama</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape" target="_blank">raping</a>&nbsp;two&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American" target="_blank">White American</a>&nbsp;women on a train in 1931.

William Jay rejected tactics of entrapment, such as persuading a book dealer to sell a copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover. He also persuaded Sumner to tolerate some writings on birth control. &nbsp;In a speech to Italian Presbyterians about the Men and Religion Forward Movement, William Jay said</p><blockquote><p>If we are really going to follow the teachings of Christ and become “fishers of men,” we must go out into the world and mingle in friendly fashion with all those we come in contact with…There are many people already in the Church who don’t believe in playing cards, using tobacco, or going to the theater. But if doing these things is going to enable me to bring people who now do them into the Church I am going to do them</p>
<p>The men of his country are beginning to realize that they have cared too much about comfort and too little about character in the past.

There were the usual financial irregularities, which New York was not shocked by, but it learned that run of the mill corruption could lead to murder. He organized the Committee of a Thousand which eventually got rid of Jimmy Walker.</p><blockquote><p>In<span style="color: #000000;">creasing social unrest led to investigations into corruption within his administration, and he was eventually forced to testify before the investigative committee of Judge&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Seabury_(judge)" target="_blank">Samuel Seabury</a>, the&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabury_Commission" target="_blank">Seabury Commission</a>&nbsp;(also known as the Hofstadter Committee). Walker caused his own downfall by accepting large sums of money from businessmen looking for municipal contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One surprise witness in the Seabury investigation was Vivian Gordon. She informed the investigators that women were falsely arrested and accused of&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution" target="_blank">prostitution</a>&nbsp;by the&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" target="_blank">New York City Police Department</a>. For this, the police officers were given more money in their paychecks. After her testimony, Vivian Gordon was suspiciously found strangled to death in a park in the Bronx. This event demonstrated to New Yorkers that corruption could lead to terrible consequences and that Walker might ultimately, in some way, be responsible for her death.</span></p>

Roosevelt</a>&nbsp;knew he had to do something about Walker and his administration. Knowing that the State’s constitution could allow an elected mayor to be removed from office, Roosevelt felt compelled to act on this. But if he did this, he risked losing Tammany Hall’s support for the Democratic nomination. On the other hand, if Roosevelt did nothing, or let Walker off easy, the national newspapers would consider him weak.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Facing pressure from Governor Roosevelt, Walker eluded questions about his personal bank accounts, stating instead that the money he received were “beneficences” and not bribes.<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span>He delayed any personal appearances until after&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Democratic_National_Convention" target="_blank">Roosevelt’s nomination</a>&nbsp;for President of the U.S. was secured. It was at that time that the embattled mayor could fight no longer. Months from his&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1932" target="_blank">national election</a>, Roosevelt decided that he must remove Walker from office. Walker agreed and resigned on September 1, 1932, and went on a grand tour of&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a>&nbsp;with Betty Compton, his&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegfeld_girl" target="_blank">Ziegfeld girl</a>.<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span>Walker stayed in Europe until the danger of criminal prosecution appeared remote.<span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span>There, he married Compton.</span></p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;">___________________</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>William Jay Schieffelin was without doubt a superior man. His intellect was demonstrated by his attaining a Ph. D. in Chemistry from Munich, which meant that he was not simply a brilliant chemist, and fluent in German, but fluent in scientific German. His energy, dedication, and zeal were inexhaustible, and he devoted much of it to helping the downtrodden.</p><p>Reformers can be tedious, and occasionally William Jay let slip what he thought of us lesser mortals, white and black:</p><blockquote><p>The bad Southerner, the poor white trash, &nbsp;complain that they cannot get work owing to the competition of educated colored men…</p>
<p>The negro is not economically fitted to be a city dweller. His impulsive nature, for one thing, unfits him to meet the excitement and strain of city life.</p></blockquote><p>But his Christianity preserved him from the dark folly of eugenics, which some members of his extended family fell into.</p><p>The morality of society, like any system, is subject to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy. Any system, unless it receives energy from outside, tends to disorganization and chaos. William Jay was one of the people who put lots of moral energy back into the system.

						<p>William Jay Schieffelin Jr. married&nbsp; Annette Markoe (1897-1997).&nbsp; She was the daughter of Dr. James Wright Markoe, the personal physician and friend of J. P. Morgan. Morgan and Markoe were both members of St. George’s Church, where William Jay Schieffelin was a vestryman, As a project closely associated with the church. Morgan gave money to found the Lying-in Hospital, Markoe’s project (his specialty was obstetrics). Morgan, who died in 1913, left Markoe an annuity of $25,000 a years ($600,000 in 2015 dollars)</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/james-wright-markoe.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3890" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/james-wright-markoe.jpg" alt="James wright markoe" width="250" height="293"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>James Wright Markoe</strong></em></span></p><p>Dr. James Wright Markoe (1862-1920), William Jay Schieffelin Jr.’s father in law, was involved in two events that show that the troubles we are now experiencing with terrorists (then German, now Islamicists) and mass murderers are not unprecedented.

He got his B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1899 and taught at a private school. He married Leone Krembs in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to Harvard to work on his Ph.D and taught German at Radcliffe. In 1906 while his wife was pregnant with their second child, he slowly poisoned her with arsenic. She was a Christian Scientist and did not summon a doctor, a although she felt unwell She died ten days after giving birth, He suddenly departed from Cambridge, taking his two children and his wife’s casket which he would cremate. But the police were suspicious and had kept some tissue from the autopsy, which revealed arsenic poising. They put out a notice for his arrest, but he had vanished.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/mrs-muenter.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/mrs-muenter.png" alt="Mrs Muenter" width="180" height="195"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>Mrs. Muenter</strong></em></span></p><p>He had deposited the two children with relatives in Chicago and seems to have gone to Mexico There he shaved his beard and took a new name, Frank Holt. He spoke English with a German accent, but claimed to have been born in the German-speaking area of Texas. &nbsp;&nbsp;He moved to Fort Worth and studies for B.A. at Polytechnic (now Texas Wesleyan). He impressed everyone with his brilliance and married Leone Sensabaugh, who graduated the same year he did, 1909. Her father was the socially-prominent minister of the Fifth Street Methodist Church.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/frank-holt-cornell1.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3900" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/frank-holt-cornell1.png" alt="Frank Holt Cornell" width="143" height="186"></a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>Frank Holt – Eric Muenter as Polytechnic Graduate</strong></em></span></p><p>In 1910 he was an instructor at the University of Oklahoma. Then he moved to Vanderbilt University in 1911-12, then Henry &amp; Emory College, and then to Cornell. One of his colleagues from Harvard spotted him at a conference and informed the head of the department at Cornell that Frank Holt was really Erich Muenter, but no one informed the police. Muenter-Holt accepted a position in Dallas and his wife moved there to set up house.</p><p>After the war began in August 1914, Muenter-Holt brooded over the mounting casualty lists. He decided the need to do something dramatic to get the attention of the United States and force it to realize the folly and horror of war. He went to New York and rented a house under the name of Patton, There he assembled a bomb factory, buying 150 lbs. of dynamite under the name of Hendricks.</p><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/muenter-bomb-chest-300x276.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3940" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/muenter-bomb-chest-300x276.png" alt="Muenter bomb chest" width="300" height="276" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>On July 2, 1915, he took a train to Washington and entered the Capitol building. Security was non-existent. He wanted to place a bomb in the Senate Chamber but it was locked. He placed the bomb in the ante-room and timed it to go off at 11:23&nbsp;&nbsp; p.m. to avoid causalities. He went to Union Station and waited for the midnight rain to New York. He heard the bomb go off.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/capitol-bombing1-300x240.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3902" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/capitol-bombing1-300x240.png" alt="Capitol bombing" width="300" height="240" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Senate Antechamber</em></span></strong></p><p>He wrote, under the name of Pearce, to the Washington papers:</p><blockquote><p>We stand for PEACE AND GOOD WILL to all men, and yet, while our European brethren are madly setting out to kill one another we edge em on and furnish them more effective means of murder. Is it right? We get rich by exportation of explosives, but ought we to enrich ourselves when it means the untold suffering and death of millions of our brethren and their widows and orphans?</p>
<p>By the way, don’t put this on the Germans or on Bryan. I am an old-fashioned American with a conscience, if it is not a sin to have a conscience). We are within the international law when we make this blood money but are we also within the moral law, the law of Peace, or of Love, or of Christ, or whatever else a Christian nation may call it? Are we within reason? Our children have to live after us. Europe helped and encouraged the Balkans in their bestial ware, and she reaped the whirlwinds. Can’t we learn wisdom? Is it right to supply an insane asylum with explosives? Or give them to children? We even prevent our own children to kill and maim themselves at the rate of 200 dead and 5,000 maimed on the glorious Fourth. How much more should we not hesitate to furnish strangers, and they mad? Will our explosives not become boomerangs? If we are willing to disregard our ideals for a dollar, will they hesitate some day when they get a chance? A prostitute sells out for a dollar. Fi! Columbia too?</p>
<p>Wilson said in his Decoration Day speech that the war developed national spirit. Good! Now let peace make for national spirit. Let all real Americans say: “We will not be a party to this wholesale murder!” Would that not be national spirit? Better than one based on the murder of our fellow-man.</p>
<p>“I, too, have had to use explosives (for the last time I trust). It is the export kind, and ought to make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war and blood money. This explosion is the exclamation point to my appeal for peace.”</p></blockquote><p>He had written letters to the newspaper denouncing J. P. Morgan, Jr.’s financing of the Allies in the war.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/j.-p.-morgan-jr.1-161x300.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em><strong>J. P. Morgan, Jr.&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p><p>Muenter took the early train to Glen Cove, Long Island on July 4, 2015. J. P. Morgan, Jr., and his family were having breakfast with the British ambassador.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3880" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/j-p-mprgan-estate-300x160.jpg" alt="J P Mprgan estate" width="300" height="160" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Matinecock Point</em></span></strong></p><blockquote><p>Presenting his business card to the butler, he asked to be directed to Morgan. The butler refused but upon being confronted with two pistols pulled from Holt’s pockets deceived him by leading him to the distant library. Morgan and his family were, in fact, breakfasting at the other end of the mansion with the British ambassador. Soon realizing he had been deceived Holt began a search, with the butler at gunpoint, room to room. Upon their approach to the dining area, the butler shouted out a warning and the family scrambled for cover.</p>
<p>Muenter, realizing that the he had been fooled by the butler, had started back to the main staircase. Along the way, he heard voices from a small side room. He entered to find Morgan’s younger children at play. He pointed a pistol at them. “Where is Mr. Morgan?” he asked. The children didn’t answer. Muenter demanded they follow him. Finding the main hallway deserted, he started up the main staircase, the children following a few steps behind. As Muenter reached the second floor landing, a loaded revolver in each hand, he yelled out “Now, Mr. Morgan, I have you!” Seeing the pistols, Mrs. Morgan heroically tried to place herself between Muenter and her husband. Morgan pushed her aside, and lunged at Muenter. Muenter fired two rounds into Morgan before he was smashed to the ground by the 220-lb bulk of the millionaire. He pulled the trigger two more times, but the gun misfired both times. Morgan landed with the weight of his body squarely on Muenter They struggled for a moment until Morgan twisted the revolver from Muenter’s hand. Morgan had landed in such a way that he had accidently pinned Muenter’s left hand, holding the second revolver, to the floor in such a way that Muenter was unable to fire it. Morgan’s wife, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice and Miss McCabe pried the second revolver from Muenter’s grasp.</p>
<p>After taking away his guns and tying him up for the police, another servant noticed the dynamite sticking out of Holt’s pocket. The dynamite was immediately placed in a pail of water. “</p></blockquote><p>Dr. Markoe and the police were summoned. Morgan survived. But Muenter did not live long.</p><p>Muenter explained his plan to the police:</p><blockquote><p>I have a well-trained mind and I studied for a long time as to what would be the proper course for me to pursue before I decided to take the matter up with Mr. Morgan personally… I wanted to go to every manufacturer personally, and persuade him to stop this traffic. It was physically impossible for me to do this, but Mr. Morgan, with his great influence could do what was impossible for me, and so I decided to apply to him.” He explained that it had been his intention to take Morgan’s wife and children hostage. Muenter intended to seal them into a room while he forced Morgan to do his bidding to stop munitions shipments to Europe. He had planned to cut a small hole with his pocketknife in the doorway of the room he placed the Morgan family in, through which he intended to pass food during what even he perceived would have been a lengthy siege.</p></blockquote><p><a href="/site/site/assets/files/1052/eric-muenter.png" rel="prettyPhoto[3894]" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3881" src="/site/site/assets/files/1052/eric-muenter.png" alt="Eric Muenter" width="189" height="237"></a></p><p>Muenter was questioned by the police:</p><blockquote><p>MacDonald next asked Muenter whether or not he thought he had a legal right to take action against Morgan. Muenter responded that it had “…nothing to do with legal right. My dear sir, this is war, you are mistaken.” “But we are not at war.” “You are wrong. We are at war. We are actually at war, we are killing thousands of people every day.” “But we haven’t declared war,” MacDonald reminded him. “Yes, we are doing it underhandedly,” Muenter replied. “Do you think that you, single-handed, could arrest the whole trend of an age?” “No, but Mr. Morgan could.”</p>

The blast killed 30 people immediately, and another eight died later of wounds sustained in the blast. There were 143 seriously injured, and the total number of injured was in the hundreds. The bombing was never solved, although investigators and historians believe the&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" target="_blank">Wall Street</a>&nbsp;bombing was carried out by&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleanist" target="_blank">Galleanists</a>&nbsp;(Italian&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist" target="_blank">anarchists</a>), a group responsible for a&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_United_States_anarchist_bombings" target="_blank">series of bombings the previous year</a>.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The New York assistant district atto</span>rney noted that the timing, location, and method of delivery all pointed to Wall Street and J.P.

Kennedy.&nbsp; There was carnage. A woman’s head was discovered stuck to the concrete wall of a building, with a hat still on it. The head of the horse was found not far from the blast, but its hooves turned up blocks away in every direction. Morgan himself was on vacation across the Atlantic, but his son Junius was injured, and Morgan’s chief clerk, Thomas Joyce, was killed.</p></blockquote><p>Our current problems with terrorism had their precedent in the early twentieth century. The United States had a large immigrant population. An element of the German population was more loyal to the Kaiser than to the United States, The Irish hated the English. Italians had an anarchist element. Russian Jews had a Bolshevik element.</p><p>Today the only immigrant population that harbors disloyal elements is the Moslem (perhaps 2% of the population) and only a miniscule fraction of them are disloyal.</p><p>The problem of the mentally ill remains with us. It is even harder today than it was then to commit someone involuntarily. Paranoid schizophrenics can be intelligent and conceal their illness. Often an erratic person will give only moderate signs before engaging in mass murder. It is harder to buy dynamite, but it is easy for a mentally ill person to get a gun, or a whole arsenal.</p><p>As to Muenter: he gave no clue as to why he murdered his first wife, and his plan to have Morgan end the war was deeply irrational. But how rational were the government officials and generals and financiers who kept the slaughter going year after year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="themify_builder_content-3894" data-postid="3894" class="themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-3894 themify_builder themify_builder_front">
